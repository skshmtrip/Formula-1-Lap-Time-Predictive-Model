HOW THE CODE WORKS:

1. In the model's program, I imported pandas and two sublibraries from Scikit-Learn: ensemble and metrics. I then imported the class RandomForestRegressor from the ensemble sublibrary and mean_absolute_error from the metrics sublibrary.
2. I assign the lap_dataset.csv to a data frequency variable using pandas.
3. I then had to encode the event column of the data as it's not quite possible (at least in my knowledge) to train any kind of random forest model on raw string data directly. How does the encoding pipeline work you might be asking? First you initialize a list for the event dictionary. You then get all the unique event names from the data. And then in order, for each event, you run a loop that iterates through the data on condition that the even it unique, then you assign it a respective value in the list by adding a value to the list which would be the length of the list (eg. Pre-Season Track Session would be index 0 in the list because it is the first unique event in the data and the length of the list at that time would be 0). Then in the dataframe add a new column for Event_ID to represent the each event numerically.
4. Then I'm looking to set what I want to predict with vs. what I'm actually predicting. I set a features list with the input parameters "Driver", "AirTemp", "TrackTemp", and "EventID". Then I set a variable name target to the parameter "LapTime"
5. Next, I prepared the data for training. First, I dropped any rows that had missing values in either the features or the target column to avoid errors during model fitting. Then, I calculated a split index to separate the data into training and testing sets; I chose 80% of the data for training and the remaining 20% for testing. Using pandas’ iloc, I sliced the dataframe into train_df and test_df, then separated the features (X_train, X_test) from the target (y_train, y_test) so the model knows what inputs correspond to what outputs.
6. After that, I initialized the Random Forest Regressor model with 100 estimators and a maximum depth of 8 to prevent overfitting, and set a random seed for reproducibility. Then I fit the model to the training data using model.fit(). Once the model learned from the training set, I ran predictions on the test set using model.predict() and calculated the mean absolute error with mean_absolute_error() to get an idea of how accurate the model is on unseen data. I then printed out the MAE to give feedback on the training quality.
7. Finally, I added a user input section to make the model interactive. I first printed all known events so the user could select from the trained data. Then, I mapped session types to numerical values using a dictionary. Using a try-except block, I requested the driver number, air and track temperatures, event name, and session type from the user. I validated the inputs by checking if the event exists in the training data and if the session type is valid. If everything checks out, I converted the inputs into a format the model can understand, ran model.predict() on the sample, and printed the predicted lap time rounded to three decimal places. If the user entered an invalid input type, the program gracefully handled it with an error message instead of crashing.
